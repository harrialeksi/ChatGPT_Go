I asked ChatGPT about Go language and show examples about 12-Factor App, API, Web, microservices development, etc. It turns out to be pretty good at generating concise programs akin to online tutorials. Of course, there is testing required, it is not production-ready and at best, mostly educational.

And that's the point of ChatGPT and AI in general as far as programming is concerned.

I want to explore how ChatGPT can help to build a repository of ready-to-run programs to accelerate learning Go, and see how AI can help us move up the value chain instead of fighting it.

Feel free to star, fork or create pull request.

This is going to be an exciting journey!
