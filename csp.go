/*
In this example, we define a single handler function that sets the Content Security Policy header using w.Header().Set. In this case, the policy 
specifies that resources should only be loaded from the current origin ('self') by default, and that scripts may also be loaded from cdn.example.com.

We then register the handler function with the server using http.HandleFunc and start the server using http.ListenAndServe.

Note that this is just a basic example to get you started with Content Security Policy in Go. You should carefully review the documentation for CSP 
and configure it according to your specific needs. Additionally, you may want to consider using a package like go-csp to simplify CSP configuration 
and management.
