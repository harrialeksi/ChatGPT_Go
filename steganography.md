how to embed 10MB text file into images using auyer/steganography

To embed a 10MB text file into an image using the "auyer/steganography" library in Go, you can follow these steps:

Install the "auyer/steganography" library: Open your Go project and install the "auyer/steganography" library using the go get command:

go get github.com/auyer/steganography

Import the "auyer/steganography" library: In your Go code, import the "auyer/steganography" library by adding the following import statement:

import "github.com/auyer/steganography"

Load the image and text file: Load the image and text file that you want to embed. You can use Go's built-in file operations to read the image and text file 
into memory.

```go
imageFile, err := os.Open("image.png") // Replace with your image file path
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}
defer imageFile.Close()

image, _, err := image.Decode(imageFile)
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}

textFile, err := os.Open("text.txt") // Replace with your text file path
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}
defer textFile.Close()

textData, err := ioutil.ReadAll(textFile)
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}
```

Embed the text data into the image: Use the "auyer/steganography" library to embed the text data into the image. You can call the steganography.Embed function 
with the image and text data as arguments, and specify the desired output file name for the resulting steganographic image.

```
encodedImage, err := steganography.Embed(image, textData)
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}

outputFile, err := os.Create("output.png") // Replace with your desired output file name
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}
defer outputFile.Close()

err = png.Encode(outputFile, encodedImage)
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}
```

Save the encoded image: Finally, save the encoded image to a file using Go's built-in file operations. In this example, we save the encoded image as a PNG file, 
but you can choose a different image format based on your requirements.
That's it! The text file data should now be embedded into the image using steganography. Keep in mind that steganography techniques can vary in terms of security 
and robustness, so make sure to carefully evaluate the suitability of the "auyer/steganography" library for your specific use case and threat model.
